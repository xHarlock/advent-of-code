## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual online event where participants are presented with a series of small programming puzzles throughout December. It starts on December 1st and continues until Christmas, with a new challenge unlocked each day. These challenges, often themed around holiday stories and settings, are designed to be solved using code. They range in difficulty and can typically be tackled using any programming language. The event attracts coders of all skill levels, from beginners to seasoned professionals, providing a fun and engaging way to improve coding skills or learn new programming languages. Advent of Code is both a learning opportunity and a playful coding challenge that celebrates the festive season in a uniquely digital way.
